### Dark Mode Classic
Dark mode addon for classic WoW. Essentially another Lorti UI fork.



For those that like Dark Mode on everything. Keeps the base UI look but darkens most aspects of it. Added in a few more features that add flavor but maintain the original aesthetic.

Big thanks to Lorti, Chordsy, and Sinope, for Lorti UI which built the base for this addon.
Syiana from SUI for the thick frames, raidframes, castbar, and system stats tracker.
Wish I could find the name of the ForgeUsers that made the classportraits originally to give them credit.
And finally, thanks to DahkCeles and plusmouse from the WoWUIDev Discord server that helped me set up configuration options for user customization and properly darkening the stopwatch frame.

##Recommended addons:

Modern TargetFrame and FormatFix - Two addons that show target frame hp and mana values, and then formats them to show the current value only
Leatrix Plus - Hides chat frame buttons and adds many more quality of life features
KuiNameplates or any nameplate addon of your choice - Changes the base UI nameplate since this addon does not address that frame
Bartender4 or Dominos - Action bar addons that are supported but won't darken their art frames

##Font:

Create a folder named Fonts in the same folder that has your WowClassic.exe file. The directory path should look something like this /ProgramFiles/World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/
Look up a font called Prototype and download it from dafont.com. Unzip the .zip file you just downloaded. Make 4 copies of the Prototype.ttf file, you can discard the Prototype.txt file.
Copy the 4 Prototype.ttf files you have to the Fonts folder and rename each as one of the following:

ARIALN.ttf
FRIZQT__.ttf
MORPHEUS.ttf
skurri.ttf
